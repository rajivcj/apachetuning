A script to calculate the maxclients that has to be set for apache in your server.
 
 To obtain the optimum maxclients value, we need to check the memory used by apache over a period of 24hr. That is just what this script does.

This script is split up into 4 sections.
  setcron
  calculate
  optimeze
  removecron

Usage

Make the script executable and execute it.

What happens

When it is executed the first time, setcron() is invoked which sets cron to run calculate() every 10 min, optimeze() after 23 hrs and removecron() after 24 hours.
When calculate() runs every 10 min, it calculates the memory used my httpd and writes it to a file '/apachetunig/result.txt'. The dir apachetunig is created when the script is first run.
When optimeze() runs after 23 hours, it will take the values from /apachetunig/result.txt and calculate the average memory used by httpd and also calculate the maxclients value and store it into a file '/apachetunig/maxclient.txt'.
Then removecron() restores the cron file '/var/spool/cron/root' with '/var/spool/cron/root-preedit' which was taken when the script was first run.

NB: memory used by other processes is set as 512MB. It is hardwired into the script. Feel free to change it to what you need.
NB: Do not add any cron jobs for root during this 24hr gap as it will be lost.
Hope you find it useful. :)
